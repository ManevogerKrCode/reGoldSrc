# reGS: reverse-engineered GoldSrc engine

This is private repository of reGS source code.

## Goal

We want to keep compatibility with original GoldSrc parts (network/GameUI and other libraries). Also, we try to fix bugs of the original engine and its components.

## Building

Currently this project supports only Windows.
